Envelope Systems
================

Data about the thermal properties of construction materials are stored in ``..databases/systems/envelope_systems.xls``.
The data are classified in a spreadsheet according the next type of building envelope systems.

-  ``CONSTRUCTION``: type of construction (light/medium/heavy).
-  ``LEAKAGE``: tightness of building envelope (highly tight/.../very leaky).
-  ``WINDOW``: physical properties of the windows by window type.
-  ``ROOF``: physical properties of the roof by roof construction type.
-  ``WALL``: physical properties of the roof by wall construction type.
-  ``SHADING``: shading properties by type of shading system available.
